### DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean is one of the cheapest and simpliest cloud providers available. If using digitalocean, you must be able to obtain your [own api key](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/) after creating an account.

To create and register a ssh key, you can first create your ssh key locally, then [add your public key to DO](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/).

In your createDroplet code, you will need to change the `"ssh_keys":null,` entry to add the id associated with your ssh key.

You can retrieve the associated id using the api:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $DOTOKEN" "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/account/keys"
```

Finally, you can change the code to use the id: `"ssh_keys":[12345...],`.
