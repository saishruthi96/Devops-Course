# HW #1B - Configuring Servers

Automatically configuring a computational resource will be one of the most important skills for you to master in your career.  You have gained experience using [ansible](https://developers.digitalocean.com/v2/) to automatically setup tasks on a virtual machine.

In this homework assignment, you will complete the following tasks:

* Using ansible, be able to automatically configure a server running jenkins.
* Abide by the following constraints:

  - Setup necessary runtime packages automatically.
  - Be able to setup jenkins configuration files automatically.
  - Be able to automatically setup a job to build [this repo](https://github.com/CSC-326/JSPDemo)
* Answer conceptual questions.
 
## Concepts

Answer in your own words the following questions:

1. What are some benefits of continuous integration?
2. What are some risks of not using continuous integration?
3. What are some reasons why a company may use a dedicated build team?
4. What are some barriers to applying continuous integration in priorierty contexts? 
   [Base answers on findings from this paper](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~digd/courses/cs561_F16/pdfs/icse17-CI.pdf)
