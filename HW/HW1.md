## HW1 - Configuration Management

Automatically configuring a computational resource will be one of the most important skills for you to master in your career.  You have gained experience using [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) to automatically setup tasks on a virtual machine.

### Creating your own mini VCL.

In this homework assignment, you will complete the following tasks:

* Using ansible, be able to automatically configure a headless ubuntu 16.04 server running VirtualBox, with phpVirtualBox, and vagrant. Follow this [guide](https://www.ostechnix.com/install-oracle-virtualbox-ubuntu-16-04-headless-server/).
* Abide by the following constraints:
  - Use best practices (use modules to do work, avoid shell/commands, be idempotent, use roles when sensible)
  - Everything is setup automatically.
  - Demo a working version of phpVirtualBox for creating a VM.
  - Demo a task for creating a new VM using vagrant.
  - No credit given for ansible galaxy roles.

## Submission

Please [submit your repo here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFR9GuPUWcMSlWQMmA0UJeBcrjCzKK0c65G_vKQKvrBqsrmw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

In your repository, have your code, link to a screencast. Screencast should illustrate a) running ansible scripts to setup your mini VCL, b) demo using vagrant and phpVirtualBox.

The assignment is due Friday, September 8th at midnight.
