# Milestone: SPECIAL

### Special component

You must add a new idea to your pipeline. Choose one of the following:

- a chaos experiment
- introduce new infrastructure upgrades
- something cool.

### Screencast

Prepare a 4 minute screencast demonstrating your entire project, detailing the overall architecture of pipeline, as well as details of the components. Leave at least 1 minute allocated to your special milestone. You will want to make this a professionally edited video -- something that you can show to others when you go on the job market.

*BONUS:* The best 3 project presentations will get +10% bonus.

### Evaluation

* Something cool: 60%
* Project Screencast: 40%
