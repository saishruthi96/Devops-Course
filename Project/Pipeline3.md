# Pipeline > Deploy

For this milestone and project, you will continue to work in teams of 3 people.

## General Tasks

* Provision cloud instances and setup monitoring infrastructure.
* Implement deployment to cloud instances.
* Implement canary analysis (checkbox.io preview microservice)

### Project Driver

Ensure the following command still operates in order to bring up your configuration and jenkins server:

```bash
# Configure jenkins, build environments, build jobs
# --gh-user and --gh-pass should be used for accessing iTrust repo on github.ncsu.edu
$ pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>
# This command should copy a .vault-pass file, with the password "csc-devops-2020" from the host to VM home directory. The .vault-pass file should be excluded from source control_. 
```

Extend your node.js project to support the following commands:

```bash
# Provision cloud instances
$ pipeline prod up
<output inventory.ini with production assets>

# Setup monitoring infrastructure on given infrastructure 
$ pipeline monitor-setup -i inventory.ini

# Perform a deployment of checkbox.io with given inventory
$ pipeline deploy checkbox.io -i inventory.ini

# Trigger a build job (named iTrust), wait for output, and print build log.
# Extend your jenkins build job to create a war file for deployment.
$ pipeline build iTrust -u <admin> -p <admin>

# Perform a deployment of iTrust with given inventory
$ pipeline deploy iTrust -i inventory.ini

# Construct canary infrastructure, collect data, and perform analysis on the given branches.
$ pipeline canary master broken
<report and canary score and whether passed or failed>
...
```

### Provision cloud instances.

Your `prod up` command should provision instances for your target infrastructure on a cloud provider. It should also generate an inventory.ini with your cloud resources. You most likely will want to reuse/extend code from the [provision workshop](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Provision) and homework to accomplish this goal.

### Deploy checkbox.io and iTrust

Deploy checkbox.io and iTrust to your production environment provided in inventory.ini. You should be able to mostly reuse parts of your roles for building the configuration server and production. Be mindful of places you may have hard-coded paths (e.g. `/home/vagrant`) and variables, as this likely to change for production.s

##### iTrust

You will need to extend your jenkins build job to create a war file for deployment---add the step `mvn package` to create the war file, if the build is successful. Your `deploy` command will then use the last built project as part of the deployment process. Optionally, you may consider using the artifact mechanism in jenkins: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/core/#archiveartifacts-archive-the-artifacts

The production environment will need a tomcat webserver (Tomcat 9) that can serve the iTrust war file, in addition to java and mysql dependencies. 

##### checkbox.io

You will need to configure nginx to serve the static website content as well as routing api requests to the backend (e.g. `/api => localhost:3002)`. You can see an [example nginx configuration](https://github.com/chrisparnin/checkbox.io/tree/master/local-conf) in checkbox.io repo.

You will also need a process supervisor, such as forever or pm2, to ensure the server.js is running on checkbox.io.

### Canary Analysis

Implement Netflix style red-black deployment with canary analysis of a microservice.

You will be targeting the preview microservice extracted from checkbox.io:
https://github.com/chrisparnin/checkbox.io-micro-preview

Create an automated analysis that can perform the following tasks and generate canary score and report:

1. Construct a computing environment with three VMs as shown in diagram (locally)
2. Generate load to the proxy server by requesting the `/preview` service.
3. For the first 1 minute, send the load to the blue instance, collect health metrics.
4. Next, send traffic to the green instance for 1 minute, collect health metrics.
5. Report a statistical comparision between health values and compute a canary score. Determine whether canary has "passed" or "failed". 

You should be able to reuse/extend code from the [Monitoring](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Monitoring) and [Deployment workshop](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Deployment). You might find [this gist](https://gist.github.com/gungorbudak/1c3989cc26b9567c6e50) useful for doing [statistical u-tests](https://www.gungorbudak.com/blog/2016/01/16/mann-whitney-u-test-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test-javascript/). You are strongly encouraged to explore and measure multiple metrics in order to maximize your likelihood of detecting differences between the control and canary server.

#### Bonus: Monitoring Dashboard

Create a `monitor-setup -i inventory.ini` command that deploys a monitoring dashboard that can report metrics associated with the deployed applications. You will need to devise a strategy for collecting metrics from deployed applications (checkbox.io and iTrust). You may reuse/extend code from the [Monitoring workshop](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Monitoring) or automatically configure a monitoring tool.

Expose the dashboard endpoint on `http://<monitoring ip>/dashboard`.

### Recommendation: Local development

For testing purposes and to support easier local development, you should be able to swap out your dynamically created inventory with this static one. **Note:** you will want to make sure you update your deployment playbooks to use a host names consistent with this inventory schema:

```ini
[itrust]
192.168.33.22 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.bakerx/insecure_private_key ansible_user=vagrant

[checkbox]
192.168.33.23 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.bakerx/insecure_private_key ansible_user=vagrant

[monitor]
192.168.33.24 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.bakerx/insecure_private_key ansible_user=vagrant
```

You can test your complete pipeline by provisioning locally

```bash
bakerx run monitor focal --ip 192.168.33.24
bakerx run checkbox focal --ip 192.168.33.23
bakerx run itrust focal --ip 192.168.33.22
```

And then running:

```
pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>
pipeline monitor-setup -i inventory.ini

pipeline build iTrust -u <admin> -p <admin>
pipeline deploy iTrust -i inventory.ini

pipeline deploy checkbox.io -i inventory.ini
```

## Team responsibilities

### ðŸ‘¥ Task leaders 

Each major task should have a team member responsible for implementing the majority of the assigned task.

Use your GitHub Project Board (e.g. Milestone1) to help coordinate and assign tasks.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

### Checkpoint and milestone report.

##### Checkpoint

There will be one checkpoints where you will be required to report interim progress (CHECKPOINT.md).

* Checkpoint due: April 26th

Document your current progress and team contributions. Note work you have completed and what work will be done next. You may find it useful to take screenshots of your GitHub Projects.

_Points will be deducted for teams not making steady progress throughout the milestone._

##### Milestone report

Document the experiences you have in learning about setting up the system, and implementing your deployment techniques. This can be described in your submission's README.md.

## M3 Evaluation

* Provision instances (20%).
* Implement configuration steps for deployment (20%).
* Canary analysis (40%).
* Checkpoint and milestone report (10%).
* Screencast (10%)
* Monitoring dashboard (+15%)

Points may be deducted for not following constraints, poor quality of implementation, poor task communication and delegation, or failing to include sufficient detail required to evaluate capabilities.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

## Final demo video

Finally, create a demo video (2--3 minutes), showcasing your project, the design and implementation of your pipeline, 
and highlight your pipeline in action (M1--M3). The intention of this video is to make it easier to showcase your work as part of your work portofolio.

## Submission

Commit your all your work related to your project into your designated repository before the final deadline. Create a branch called `M3` to hold a snapshot of your work related to this milestone.

Ensure your repository contains:

* a top-level node.js project supporting the required commands for running your build server.
* a README.md, with your report details.
* a CHECKPOINT.md, with your checkpoint report.
* a link to screencast that demostrates each task.

**Last code check-in: Due Monday, May 3rd, before midnight.**  

**Final demo video: Due Wednesday, May 5th, before noon.**
