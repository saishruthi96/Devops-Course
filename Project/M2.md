MILESTONE: TEST+ANALYSIS
------------------------

In creating your pipeline, you need a **testing component** and **analysis component** that ensures the correctness of a commit.

### Properties

The testing and analysis components must support the following properties.

* **Test Suites**: The ability to run unit tests, measure coverage, and report the results.

* **Advanced Testing**: Implement one of the following advanced testing techniques: test priorization, test case generation, fuzzing, or flaky test quarantine.

* **Basic Analysis** The ability to run an existing static analysis tool on the source code (e.g. FindBugs, PMD, CheckStyle, NCover, Lint, etc.), process its results, and report its findings.

* **Custom Metrics**: The ability to implement your own custom source metrics.

   * Max condition: Count the max number of conditions within an if statement in a function.
   * Long method: Detect a long methods.
   * Free-style: Implement any analysis, such as security-token detection.
   * BONUS (10 points): Detect duplicate code using an AST-based difference algorithm.

* **Gates**  Using hooks or post-build scripts, have the ability to reject a commit if it fails a minimum testing criteria (e.g. failed test case, or less than 50% statement coverage) and analysis criteria (e.g. cannot commits that generate a particular FindBugs rule, such as "Method concatenates strings using + in a loop").

* System under test: You must find an open source project with a test suite to run through your pipeline for evaluation.

## Submission

Submit the following:

* your code and configuration files, 
* a README.md, with a \#\#\# Test section describing your testing setup and a \#\#\# Analysis section describing your base and extended analysis.
* Test cases/scripts/screenshots that demonstrate each capability.
* A screencast describing a complete end-to-end demo of I) a commit passing test and analysis II) a commit failing test or analysis and being rejected.
