## Prerequisites
CSC510 (Software Engineering) or graduate or senior standing with
at least 3.0 GPA, good knowledge of at least one high
level programming language.

Undergraduates enrolled in 419/495 are expected to complete the same course work, except they do not required to complete a "Tech Report".

## Outline

Modern software development organizations require DevOps engineers to automate and maintain software engineering processes and production infrastructure. In this course, you will gain practical exposure to the skills, tools, and knowledge needed in automating software engineering processes and infrastructure necessary for continuous deployment of software. Students will have the chance to build new or extend existing software engineering tools and design an automated deployment pipeline.

## Objectives

Students are expected to gain practical exposure to tools, processes, and principles of software engineering through hands-on projects while understanding models and research ideas behind the tools and processes.  Lectures will include workshop style learning experiences, where students get to work on a problemset and receive feedback from the instructor and other classmates.  When possible, guest lectures from industry will help illustrate examples of how the technology is deployed in practice.

## Course Topics

Topics include: Static analysis,  build management, automatic testing, goverance, quality gates, monitoring, and configuration and release management. Additional topics include provisioning, quality assurance, unit testing, test generation, static and dynamic analysis and service, platform, and infrastructure as a service.

## Course Overview

In the course, a mixture of traditional lectures with activities and in-class workshops will be used.  During lectures, we will cover core concepts related to a topic. During the in-class workshops, we will perform sample exercises with relevant tools that reinforce lecture material.  Evaluation will be based on tech talks, homework assignments, workshop attendance, and final project.

### Tech Report

Students will organize in groups and create a tech report.  For a *tech report*, students are expected to cover one tool or technology revelant to DevOps in a 10-15 minute presentation.  Students should perform a small recorded demo to help illustrate the tool.

### Homeworks

Homework assignments will be regularly released throughout the semester and reinforce class material.  Homeworks will typically mirror a scenario or common task that a DevOps engineer may face.

### Workshops/Class activities

Workshops are vital to the course. During a workshop, you'll be guided in using tools and building specific functionality which you will later use for homeworks and project miles. During the semester, workshops and class activities will be randomly assigned for attendance. 

* 1 missed activities, grade = 9
* 2 missed activities, grade = 8
* 3 missed activities, grade = 5
* 4 missed activities, grade = 2
* 5 or more missed activities, grade = 0.

### Attendance

Missing three consecutive classes will result in failure of the course.

### Project

The primary objective of the course will be to allow students to gain experience in incrementally building a continous delivery pipeline from scratch.  Throughout the semester, students are expected to complete a component of the pipeline by each milestone deadline.

Students are able to choose their own app and technology choices for building a deployment pipeline.  Otherwise, a default app and technology stack will be provided.

##### Milestones

Details on requirements for milestones will be released throughout the course.  A student's pipeline should demonstrate the following components by the milestone deadline:

* CM
* BUILD+TEST+ANALYSIS
* DEPLOY
* SPECIAL

## Late Policy
No late assignments will be accepted. Many of your assignments will be collaborative
effort with other members of your group. Thus, late papers by one member
of the group will affect the entire group. The due date for assignments will be
posted on the assignment and will generally be submitted electronically.

## Teaching Philosophy
We will make use of intensive classroom activities and readings. You will be expected to participate actively in discussions. On any given issue, you may be asked to summarize and criticize reading assignments from the text or articles that you have read for your assignments and projects. We view the web as a valuable
resource. Our course website will serve as our ”information system” this semester; you will be expected to visit the site on a daily basis for updates and to obtain your homework / project assignments.
Only you can learn. As the instructors, we can only guide and assist you. Thus, all of the class activities are aimed at helping you learn.

## Academic Integrity
The course will follow all NCSU academic [integrity regulations](http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/academic_policies). All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid another’s misrepresentation.
Any violation associated with a homework/lab assignment, project
deliverable, examination or quiz will result in a failing grade for the course. Such violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct, which may impose penalties beyond those by the instructors.

We encourage you to read the ACM Code of Ethics, particularly Sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4. (http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html)

## Equity Policy

All persons, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, physical disability or sexual orientation shall have equal opportunity without harassment in this course. Any harassment should be reported immediately to the instructor.

Students are responsible for reviewing the NC State University PRR’s which pertains to their course rights and responsibilities:

https://oied.ncsu.edu/equity/policies/ 

#### Code of Student Conduct 

Students are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner at all times. Grades will be adjusted if students do not handle themselves in a respectful and professional manner with all members of the teaching staff and with others in the class - both in person and electronically (email, message board posts).

## Students with Disabilities
The course will follow all NCSU regulations relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities), should contact the professor during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make
arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the NCSU Disability Services for Students Office regarding campus services at the Student Health Center for more information and assistance (http://www.ncsu.edu/dso/students/).

## Course Evaluation

Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of class. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations. All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.
